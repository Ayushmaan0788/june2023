\section{Law Explanation}

\subsection*{Equation}

The Stefan--Boltzmann law, also known as Stefan's law, describes the intensity of the thermal radiation emitted by matter in terms of that matter's temperature\footnote{Source: \texttt{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanâ€“Boltzmann\_law} (Ayushmaan Pattnayak - GitHub: Ayushmaan0788)}. It is named after Josef Stefan, who empirically derived the relationship, and Ludwig Boltzmann, who derived the law theoretically.

For an ideal absorber/emitter or black body, the Stefan--Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time, $j^{\star}$ (also known as the radiant exitance), is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's temperature, $T$:

\begin{equation}
    j^{\star} = \sigma T^4 \label{eq:stefan-boltzmann}
\end{equation}

The constant of proportionality, $\sigma$, is called the Stefan--Boltzmann constant. It quantifies the relationship between temperature and thermal radiation emission. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant represents the power radiated by a black body per unit surface area at a given temperature. It is a fundamental constant in physics and has a value:

\begin{equation}
    \sigma = 5.670374419 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{W m}^{-2} \text{K}^{-4} \label{eq:stefan-boltzmann-constant}
\end{equation}

In other words, for a black body, the radiant exitance is equal to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant multiplied by the fourth power of the absolute temperature.

In the general case, the Stefan--Boltzmann law takes the form:

\begin{equation}
    j^{\star} = \varepsilon \sigma T^4 \label{eq:general-stefan-boltzmann}
\end{equation}

where $\varepsilon$ is the emissivity of the matter doing the emitting. The emissivity is generally between zero and one, although some exotic materials may have an emissivity greater than one. An emissivity of one corresponds to a black body\footnote{Source: \texttt{https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Astronomy\_\_Cosmology/Stellar\_Atmospheres\_(Tatum)/02\%3A\_Blackbody\_Radiation/2.07\%3A\_Stefan's\_Law\_(The\_Stefan-Boltzmann\_Law)} (Ayushmaan Pattnayak - GitHub: Ayushmaan0788)}.
